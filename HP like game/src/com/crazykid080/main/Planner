Needs:
1. Back-end file writing system (For saving) (Should I make my own file set?)
2. IP controller
3. Connections

Later needs (DO NOT FOCUS ON YET):
Money system
Factions
In-game file system
Server commands
Scanner? (Maybe, not sure if it will happen)

Ideas:
Server{
		Commands{
				Shutdown{
					Takes server offline
					All tasks killed
					Takes 3-24 hours? (TBD)
					Requires command to boot
					Boot time = .5 of reboot time (15-30 min.)
					Clears burnout
				}
				-----
				Restart{
					Faster version of shutdown
					Automatically boots
					30-60 minutes?
					Clears burnout
				}
				-----
				Format{
					Wipes server clean
					Default software loaded
					Should this clear burnout?
				}
				Change IP{
					Gets randomized IP address
					Takes 1 Hour
					Should this add burnout?
				}
		}
	Burnout(Reduces quality of (Hard/Soft)ware){
		Max:???
		Each point degrades preformance by ??? for a maximum degredation of ???
		Reboot or shutdown resets
		One point every ???
		(Should there be software to manage burnout? If so, what rate/effectivity?)
	}

	Hardware Stats{
		Memory
		CPU
		Bandwidth
		HDD Space
	}
	-----
	Startup(Make tasks run on startup (VIRUSES ARE AUTOMATICALLY ADDED)) (Should default protection software
		be added automatically?)
